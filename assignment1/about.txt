The reserved words in the language are:
var, const, return, integer, boolean, void, main, if, else, while, skip

The following are tokens in the language:
, ; : = { } ( ) + - ∼ || && == != < <= > >=

Integers are represented by a string of one or more digits (‘0’-‘9’) that
do not start with the digit ‘0’, but may start with a minus sign (‘-’), e.g.
123, -456.

Identifiers are represented by a string of letters, digits or underscore
character (‘ ’) beginning with a letter. Identifiers cannot be reserved words.

Comments can appear between any two tokens. There are two forms of comment:
one is delimited by /* and */ and can be nested;
the other begins with // and is delimited by the end of line and this type of comments may not be nested.
